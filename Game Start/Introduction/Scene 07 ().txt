李肇维：
居然被推到了公园附近。。。。。。
-I can’t believe I was pushed all the way to a park…

敲着僵硬的肩膀，我坐在公园休息。
-While hitting my stiff shoulders, I sit in the park to rest.

晓瑜不知道有没有顺利离开，要是她真的出了什么事情，回头我就算切腹谢罪，也没脸去见老老板。
-I wonder if Xiao Yu was able to leave safely. If something happened to her, I would be too ashamed to face the old manager even if I committed seppuku.

元德那小子虽然很勇猛地逆流而上，但是太过逞强的鲑鱼，只会在溯溪的过程里把自己弄伤。
-Although Yuan De was boldly walking against the crowd, he could get hurt like the overconfident salmon that gets hurt while swimming upstream. 

希望他们两个都没事。
-I hope they are fine.
 
李肇维：
不过还真是两个长不大的孩子。。。。。。
-But they still behave like two children who won’t grow up…

说到孩子，这公园里，怎么有不少小孩子？
-Speaking of children, why are there so many children in this park?

仔细看看，连大人也混在其中。
是要去迎接光复的人吗？
-Upon taking a closer look, I notice adults among the children too.
-Are these people going to welcome the reclaiming?

看气氛不像，没有旗子，没有骚动，只有满脸的期待与有趣。
他们是在看什么东西吗？
-But the mood doesn’t seem like it, there are no flags, and there is no commotion. There are only faces full of anticipation and interest.
-Are they looking at something?

凑过去探了一眼，只见公园里多了一个没见过的华丽舞台。
那舞台很小有很高，看起来像个窗子，不像给人演戏的地方。
-I go over and take a look, and I see that the park now has a magnificent stage that I have never seen before.
-The stage is small and tall. It looks like a window, not a place where people would perform.

是要演日本街头的纸芝居吗？
-Is it for kamishibai that is performed on streets in Japan?
(Note: Kamishibai is a form of Japanese storytelling that uses large picture scrolls or cards.)

但是感觉没那么朴素。
而且，动用的道具好像更多。
-But the stage seems too elaborate for that.
-What’s more, there appear to be more tools.

而在舞台的侧面，有一扇小门，一位穿着体面，拿着纸扇的男人时进时出，似乎在观望外头人潮多寡。
-The side of the stage has a small door, through which a well-dressed man holding a paper fan is coming and going, as if he is observing the size of the crowd.

就在人潮聚集的差不多时，男人便闪回台内，接着是一阵热闹的锣鼓声响，然后——
-When the crowd is about the right size, the man disappears back inside the stage. The sound of drums follows, and then --

男人：
奔奔奔，为赶往前线，白马将军薛仁贵在荒野之上急急而奔！
-Clippity-clop, White Horse General Xue Ren Gui is riding his horse through the wilderness in a hurry to reach the front lines!

舞台起了变化。
-There is a change on the stage.

手提长戟，驾着白马的人偶然从左侧进场，在小小的舞台上来回奔驰。
-A puppet holding a halberd and riding a white horse enters from the left, and gallops around the small stage.

李肇维：
人偶文乐？
-Bunraku?
(Note: Bunraku is a form of traditional Japanese puppet theatre.)

瞬间我以为是日本的人偶戏，但是人偶后面却没有黑子，那个舞台也塞不下黑子。
而且以文乐来说，那些偶也未免太小了点？
-For a moment I think this is bunraku, a Japanese puppet performance, but there is no puppeteer behind the puppet, and a puppeteer could not fit on the small stage.
-And if this is bunraku, isn’t the puppet a bit too small?

男人：
就在这个时候，前方煞星拦路啰！
-At this moment, a malefic presence appears before him and blocks the road!

男人以激昂的语调继续说着故事。
随着故事的进展，舞台上的画面也接连变化。
-The man uses an excited tone to tell the story.
-As the story progresses, the scene on the stage also changes.

一阵锣鼓声中，右方窜出一名跨着黑马的武士人偶，横刀拦路。
-Accompanied by the sound of drums, a puppet of a warrior riding a black horse appears from the right side, and blocks the path with his weapon.

男人：
嗯？朋友，为何拦住我的去路？
-Hm? Why do you block my way, friend?

男人的声音骤变，像是刻意尖起了嗓子，在模仿人偶的声音。
配合男人的台词，舞台上的人偶也摇头晃脑，摆动长刀。
-The man changes his voice to a deliberately higher pitch to give the puppet a voice.
-The puppet on stage moves its head and swings its halberd to match the man’s lines.

男人：
哼哈哈哈哈哈。。。。。。！白马将军，我乃天下第一东瀛战将，本多忠胜！
奉了东瀛大将军的命令，前来取你人头！
-Hm ha ha ha ha ha…! White Horse General, I am the peerless Japanese warrior, Honda Tadakatsu! By order of the Japanese general, I have come to take your head!

这次男人改以粗犷的嗓音说话。
-This time the man switches to a gruff voice.

原来如此，我大概懂了。
-I see, I think I understand now.

刚才探头探脑的那个男人负责讲旁白跟台词。
随着他的话语，舞台上的人偶随之活动。
-The man who was poking his head out is in charge of narrating the script.
-The puppets on stage act according to his words. 

原本应该给人寂静感的落语或说书，因此产生了热闹的动感。
这东西有趣。
-The quiet atmosphere that usually accompanies rakugo or storytelling is turned into one of excitement by the puppets.
-This is interesting.
(Note: Rakugo is a type of Japanese storytelling)

男人：
喔，原来是大名鼎鼎的东瀛不败战神，但我薛仁贵也非易与之辈，有何能为尽展吧！
-Oh, so you are the famous invincible Japanese war god! But I, Xue Ren Gui, am not easy to defeat either, so show me the best you have!

两名人偶驾马而奔，在舞台中央绕起圈圈。眼看一场决斗就要开始，观众们的情绪也更为高涨。
-The two puppets ride their horses in circles around each other. It looks like a final showdown is about to begin, and the audience atmosphere becomes more lively.

李肇维：
可是本多忠胜为什么会说台语呢。。。。。。
-But why does Honda Tadakatsu know Taiwanese…

或许是那个男人不会说日语吧。
-Perhaps that man doesn’t know Japanese.

李肇维：
可是白马将军薛仁贵应该也不会说台语。。。。。。
-But White Horse General Xue Ren Gui shouldn’t know Taiwanese either…

看来这种陌生的戏剧，里头还有一些我搞不清楚的东西。
-It looks like there are some aspects of this strange play that I still don’t understand.

舞台后方的乐音急促，台上的人偶也开始刀戟交锋，观众忍不住跟着喝彩，为台上的白马将军声援起来。
-The music coming from behind the stage quickens, on stage the puppets begin to duel, and the audience let out cheers for the White Horse General.

？？？：
乱七八糟。
-What a mess.

我旁边有人发出了如此的评论。
-Someone next to me makes such a comment.

？？？：
马居然会倒退走。。。。。。套招偷懒也要有个限度啊！
-It’s unbelievable that a horse can walk backwards … There must be a limit to choreography laziness!

不管对方演出再怎么烂，在人家还在表演的当下如此批评，根本就是来砸场子了。
-Regardless how terrible the acting is, to utter such comments while people are performing is essentially to heckle.

我很想钦佩一下这位砸场子的朋友，于是转头。
-I really want to admire this heckler, so I turn my head to take a look.

是个女孩子。
-It’s a girl.

一边专心看着演出，一边发表砸场评论的这位朋友，是位英气出色，长发秀丽的女性。看起来不像这附近的人。
-The one who is heckling while attentively watching the play is a remarkably brave beautiful girl with long hair. She doesn’t look like a local.

？？？：
啊！偶都快落马了啦，操偶的认真一点好不好？
-Ah! The puppet is about to fall off the horse, can’t you be more serious with your puppetry?

我在意的地方是剧情的没头没尾。
她评论的重点却是人偶的动作表现。
-The things I notice are irrationalities in the plot.
-In contrast, her comments are about how the puppets move.

这个真妙了。
难道这种人偶剧，要看的不是剧情，而是动作？
-This is very amusing.
-Could it be that in this kind of puppet show, the focus is on the puppet movement instead of the story?

？？？：
所以说！。。。。。。嗯？
-That’s why!... Eh?

那名女性注意到我的视线。
-The girl notices that I am looking at her.

？？？：
啊，抱歉，我多嘴了？
-Ah, I’m sorry, did I say too much?

李肇维：
不，妳的点评很有意思，别在意我，请继续。
-No, your comments are interesting. Don’t mind me, please continue.

？？？：
这不是点评，是批评。也不是批评，是抱怨。
那出戏乱七八糟的，根本无从评起啦。
-These aren’t comments, they’re criticisms. Well, not really criticisms, they’re complaints.
-The play is such a big mess that there is nothing to comment about.

？？？：
只要稍微看过戏的都知道，那个套招偷懒到完全不像样！
-Anyone who has seen even one performance would know that this choreography is too lazy!

李肇维：
偷懒？
-Lazy?

我撇了一眼台上打个没完的两只人偶。
-I glanced at the stage where the two puppets are still fighting.

李肇维：
我觉得他们能把小小的人偶动得那么激烈，已经很厉害啦。
-I think that they are very skilful to be able to make those small puppets move so vigorously.

？？？：
布袋戏的动作才不是这样。
-The movement in glove puppetry is not like that.

女性不耐烦地抓着头。
-The girl places her hands on her head in frustration.

李肇维：
布袋戏？
-Glove puppetry?

？？？：
你看喔，现在台上两只用的都是长兵器，比刀剑更好使花招，但是他们却只会互相敲击，呆版没功力。
-Look, right now the two puppets on stage are holding polearms, which are better than swords for making flashy movements. But they are only using the polearms to strike each other, and that shows that they lack skill.

李肇维：
嗯。。。。。。那么要用功力的话，应该怎么做？
-Um… So if they were skilful, how would they do it?

？？？：
如果是我的话，这里会这么做吧？
-If it were me, I would do it this way?


？？？：
两边在马上打过一轮后，互相交击下马，有黑马骑士那边主攻。
-After fighting one round on their horses, they would dismount, and the warrior on the black horse would attack.

？？？：
他拿的是大刀，连挥三刀，薛仁贵低头连闪之后重整态势。。。。。。
-He is carrying a big sword, and makes three swift strokes. After ducking and evading, Xue Ren Gui regains his fighting stance…

？？？：
啊，不过骑黑马的那个奇怪服装感觉很硬，大概没办法做太花巧的动作。。。。。。
-Ah, but the strange costume worn by the warrior on the black horse looks very stiff, so he probably can’t make very flashy movements…

她说的黑马骑士，身上穿着的是武士铠甲，那是台湾人都知道的装扮。
-The rider of the black horse that she is referring to is wearing samurai armour, which is a costume that all Taiwanese recognise.

在皇民化运动的推动下，听说大部分的戏剧演出都必须配合日本的传奇故事。
-I heard that the Kouminka movement coerced many plays to adapt to be compatible with Japanese legends.
(Note: The Kouminka movement was to inject Japanese culture into Taiwan.)
所以那个人偶会穿着那样的衣装，也是可以理解的。
-So for that puppet to be dressed in that costume is understandable.

我看着身旁这位不了解个中缘由的女性，觉得十分新鲜。
-I look at the girl next to me who does not understand this reason, and felt that it was very refreshing.

？？？：
。。。。。。就是这样，了解了吗？
-…Just like that, do you understand now?

虽然她滔滔不绝说了很多，但我听在耳里还是一知半解。
不过看她这么认真地讲解，倒也是有趣。
-Although she spoke on and on to explain a lot, I do not fully understand.
-But it was interesting to see how seriously she explained it.

？？？：
你也应个声吧？
-Will you say something?

李肇维：
好像懂！
-I think I understand!

？？？：
喔！
-Oh!

李肇维：
但。。。。。。这人偶剧到底是什么玩意啊？
-But… What on earth is this kind of puppet show?

？？？：
咦。。。。。。啊哈哈哈！
-Eh… Ah ha ha ha!

女性闻言，却是大笑了出来。
-The girl laughed when she heard me.

？？？：
我还在想你怎么一副不懂的样子，原来。。。。。。天啊。
-I was wondering why you looked like you didn’t understand, that was why … oh, heavens.

？？？：
那我就干脆从头开始讲起好了。
-In that case, I’ll start explaining from the start.

？？？：
这种表演叫做布袋戏， 是。。。。。。
-This kind of performing is called glove puppetry, which is …

男人：
陈钰小姐，原来您在这里。
-Miss Chen Yu, so this is where you were.

女性正想继续解说，忽然有个男人插话，打断了她的话头。
-Just as the girl was about to explain glove puppetry, a man suddenly spoke up and interrupted her.

？？？：
啊，被抓到了。
-Ah, I’ve been caught.

？？？：
傻子，我先走一步啦，有机会再说吧。
-Silly, I have to go. Let’s talk again if we get the chance.

傻子。。。。。。是说我吗？
-Silly… is she referring to me?

就在女性离开时，舞台上大喊一声，本多忠胜被砍倒在地，周围观众齐声喊好。
-Just as the girl leaves, a big shout comes from the stage. Honda Tadakatsu has been felled, and the audience loudly cheers.

白马将军薛仁贵接着拿出弓箭——
一把小小的弓与点着的线香。
-White Horse General Xue Ren Gui takes out a bow --
-And nocks lit joss sticks in the small bow.
 
男人：
我薛仁贵已经杀死了东瀛战神本多忠胜，便射响箭来昭告天下！
-I, Xue Ren Gui, have slain the Japanese war god Honda Tadakatsu, so I’ll shoot these arrows to announce it to the world!

人偶搭弓射箭，把线香射出舞台，落在地上。
舞台后方窜出个人，捡起线香，点燃不知何时挂上的鞭炮。
-The puppet fires the joss sticks out of the stage and they fall on the ground.
-Someone comes out from behind the stage, picks up the joss sticks, and uses them to light firecrackers that were hung up at some point.

鞭炮乒乒砰砰地炸开，飘散出硫磺的味道。听起来就像抢炮的声音。
-The firecrackers noisily explode and release the smell of sulfur. The exploding sounds like gunfire.

我不喜欢鞭炮。烧过的硫磺闻起来很刺鼻，味道也不好。
但我倒是很喜欢刚才那个女孩——
-I don’t like firecrackers. I also don’t like the smell of burnt sulfur that stings my nostrils.
-But I really like that girl just now --

不，不是那个女孩，而是她身上散发出来的那股光华。
那是一种不顾一切，全心投入兴趣，尽情燃烧时的光。
-No, it’s not the girl, but the aura that she radiates.
-It’s a carefree, fully devoted to her interest, all fired up kind of aura.

我已经没有那种热情。
但我还是喜欢看见，这种热情燃烧时的光华。
-I no longer have that passion.
-But I still like to see that aura of burning passion.
