老家的油桐樹下，是我們玩耍的地方。
-Below the tung trees of the old house, was the place where we used to play.
Below the Tung trees of the old house, lies the place where we used to play.

在午後的陽光裡，油桐花的氣味下。
我們三個總是在吵今天的游戲誰當頭。
-In the afternoon sunlight, below the fragrance of the tung flowers.
-We three always argued who would be the leader of our games today.
Under the afternoon sunlight, enveloped by the fragrence of the Tung flowers.
Between the three of us, we have always argued over whom should be the leader for our games today.

李肇維：
“我是哥哥我當頭！”
-I am the elder brother so I’ll be the leader!
I am the older brother so I'll be the leader!

李元德：
“才怪，昨天已經是哥當頭了，今天該換我！”
-No way, you were leader yesterday, today it should be me!
No way, you were leader yesterday, today should be my turn!

*MovingGamer*
#Only one 哥

張曉瑜：
“你們兩個臭男生，沒聽過女士優先嗎？”
-You two stinky boys, haven’t you heard of ladies first?

張曉瑜：
“今天應該由我當頭，決定該玩什麼才對啊。”
-I should be the leader today, and decide what we should play.

李元德：
“我才不跟女生玩家家酒！”

*MovingGamer*
#It is 女生 instead of 女

張曉瑜：
“前天你明明就玩過！”
-You played the day before yesterday!
But you played the day before yesterday!

李元德：
“那是大爺我好心配合你們兩個小鬼頭，我決定今天玩抓鬼，有本事就來追我！”
-That was me being kind to you two brats, I decide we play catch today, chase me if you can!
That was me being kind to you two brats, I decide we play catch today, catch me if you can!

*Airi*
#This part is kind of weird. Since李元德is the younger brother, for him to call his older brother a brat is quite strange. Not sure if the original Chinese transcript was correctly copied over.
*MovingGamer*
#It is 本事 instead of 本是

張曉瑜：
“元德你給我站住！”
-Yuan De, stand right there for me!
Yuan De, get back here!

李肇維：
“不要沖那麼快啦。”
-Don’t rush off so fast.
Hey don't run off so fast.

弟弟元德一口氣沖了出去，結果在樹根上絆了一大跤。
跟我們一起玩的曉瑜追的太緊，也跟著跌在地上。
-Younger brother Yuan De dashed off in a breath, and ended up falling over a tree root.
-Xiao Yu, who was playing with us, gave chase too eagerly, and also fell on the ground.

*Airi*
#The above sentence can be reworded, but idk how right now.

李肇維：
“你們兩個没事吧？”
-Are you two OK?
Are you two OK?

*MovingGamer*
#It is 没事 instead of 麼事

我跨著輕飄飄的腳步趕到，隻見兩人摔的全身都是傷。
-I hurried over while taking light footsteps, and only saw the two of them were injured all over from falling.

李元德：
“。。。。。。這下又要給歌玩醫生游戲了。。。。。。”
-… Now we made elder brother play doctor again…
...Now we have to play doctor for big brother again...

*MovingGamer*
#It is 給哥 instead of 個歌

張曉瑜：
“有什麼不好的，肇維以後要跟伯父一樣，成為優秀的醫生啊。”
-What’s so bad about that, Zhao Wei wants to grow up to be like father’s elder brother, an outstanding doctor.
What's so bad about that, Zhao Wei is going to be like your father, an outstanding doctor.
*Airi*
#伯父is referring to zhao wei and yuan de’s father. It is a polite way to address another person’s father.

*MovingGamer*
#It was missing 有 at the start

不知什麼地方傳來槍炮的聲響。
遠遠的，好像又近近的。
-From somewhere came the sound of gunfire.
-It sounded far away, but also seemed to be nearby.

-Hey, big brother, my organs have fallen out, help me sew them back in.

張曉瑜：
“等等，應該先幫我把破掉的胸口補好。”
-Hold on, first you should help me fix my broken chest.
Hold on, first you should help me fix my broken chest.

*YourSQL*
#Wait whaaaatttt... The music does not match here lol....

李肇維：
"哎唷，你們兩個都等一下啦--"
-Aiyo, you two wait for a moment…
Aiyo, you two wait for a moment…

*Airi*
#Umm.. considering this is for English speakers, something to replace aiyo would be best; like jesus, yikes, sigh, etc…

在忽遠忽近又響個不停的槍炮聲音裡。
我弄丟了我的手指頭。
-In the sound of gunfire that endlessly rang out far and near.
-I lost my fingers.
The endless sound of gunfire rang out in the distance yet sounded close-by.
I lost my fingers.

*MovingGamer*
#It is 響個不停 instead of 響個停

李肇維：
“不管要醫誰，等我先把手指找回來再說。”
-Whoever I am curing, wait until I have found my fingers then I’ll help.

父亲：
“那麼，爸爸的手指借你把？”
-In that case, how about I lend you father’s fingers?

#There is no 頭

父親遞給我十根好大好大的手指。
上頭沾滿了黑黑的血垢。

母親：
“收下吧，肇維，這是你爸的心意啊。”
-Accept it, Zhao Wei, this is what your father wants.

母親站在後面，露出了不斷淌血的微笑。
-Mother was standing in the back, and showed me a smile that wouldn't stop bleeding.

*MovingGamer*

“爸。。。。。。媽。。。。。。?”
-Dad… Mum…?
Dad… Mum…?

*YourSQL*
#Should we go for American or British English?
*MovingGamer*
#It was missing the question mark at the end

槍炮的聲音忽遠忽近又響個不停。
-The sound of gunfire endlessly rang out far and near.
The endless sound of gunfire, once again rang out in the distance yet sounded close-by.

我再也聞不到油桐花的香氣。
以及他們聲音--
-I could no longer smell the aroma of tung flowers.
-And no longer hear their voices.
I could no longer smell the aroma of Tung flowers.
