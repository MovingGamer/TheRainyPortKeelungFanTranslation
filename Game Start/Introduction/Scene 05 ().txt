#Part 1
我跟弟弟都在路尾的茶坊工作，这里就像是街坊邻居的集会所，大家没事就会过来串个门子喝点茶。
-The teahouse at the end of the street, where my little brother and I work, is like gathering place of the locals. Whenever they have nothing to do, they will come through the teahouse doors to drink some tea.

不过今天茶坊的大门却紧闭着。
-But today the doors of the teahouse are tightly shut.

李肇维：
唉？
-Eh?

“临港茶坊”的招牌下，大门确确实实地紧闭着。
-Below the sign saying “Lingang Teahouse”, the doors are indeed shut.

平时这个时间，长工早就出出入入，好不热闹，今天却连门都忘了开，这到底是怎么啦？
-Usually at this time, labourers would be coming and going, creating a lot of hustle and bustle, but today even opening the doors has been forgotten, what could be going on?

仔细一看，门上贴着一张纸。
-Upon taking a closer look, I notice a piece of paper attached to the door.

“庆祝光复，临港茶坊本日休业一天，敬请各位乡亲父老明日再来光顾。”
-“To celebrate China reclaiming Taiwan, Lingang Teahouse will be closed today. All dear customers please come again tomorrow.”

李肇维：
原来今天放假啊。。。。。。哈哈哈。。。。。。我完全忘了呢。。。。。。
-So today is a holiday… ha ha ha… I completely forgot…

上不了工，也无处可去，这下我应该怎么办才好呢？
-I can’t work, and I have nowhere to go, what should I do now?

要找元德吗？他现在应该在迎接光复的队伍里吧？
-Should I look for Yuan De? He should currently be among the crowd that is going to welcome the reclaiming, shouldn’t he?

算了，我不喜欢人多的地方，又吵又闹又挤个乱七八糟。但是这个时间点，也不好回去睡个大头觉。
-Forget it, I don’t like places with a lot of people, they’re loud and noisy and messily congested. But at this time I can’t go home and sleep.

李肇维：
这下可糟啦。。。。。。
-This is bad…

谢霁云：
你是又被那家的婆婆问，要不要跟某家的姑娘结婚了吗？
-Were you again asked by that old woman whether you wanted to get married to the girl of some family?

李肇维：
啊，先辈！
-Ah, senpai!

谢霁云：
嘘——
-Sh -

谢霁云：
现在不是日本的时代了，还是别用日文了吧，学弟。
-Now is not the Japanese ruling era, don’t use Japanese, underclassman.

学姐露出了微笑。
-She smiled.

我的前辈，我的学姐，谢霁云，是个身材高挑，举止帅气单轮魅力绝对不输任何人的成熟女性。
-My senpai, my upperclassman, Xie Ji Yun, is a tall, slim, good-looking, charming, mature woman who won’t give in to anyone.

她是茶坊的常客，之后听说她到欧洲去了，直到最近我们才重新见面。
-She is a frequent customer at the teahouse, and until I met her again recently, I had not seen her since hearing that she went to Europe.

她是个充满不可思议气质的学姐。现在更是人脉广得不得了。每次看见她，都在跟不同的人聊。
-She is an upperclassman who is full of unbelievable traits. The current trait is that her social network is extremely wide. Every time I see her, she is talking to someone different.

李肇维：
学姐今天怎么会来？
-Why are you here today?

谢霁云：
今天我有重要客人，想说先买点茶备着，结果你们茶坊居然没开，失策，失策。
-Today I have an important guest, so I thought to buy some tea in preparation of their arrival, and I find that your teahouse is closed. What a mistake, what a mistake.

李肇维：
学姐怎么会失策呢？
-How could it be that you made a mistake?

谢霁云：
说的很好，学弟，学姐我确实准备了几个备案——比方说去找别的茶坊。
-Well said, I indeed prepared some alternatives – such as looking for another teahouse.

李肇维：
好说好说，茶坊的生意，日后还需要学姐多多照顾，不然我跟元德恐怕要失业了。
-Well said, well said, the teahouse business still needs a lot of your custom, otherwise I fear Yuan De and I will lose our jobs.

谢霁云：
那有什么关系呢？只要赶在茶坊倒闭之前，赶紧跟附近的婆婆妈妈攀好关系，找个有钱人家女儿结个婚，上个床，生几个胖娃娃，这样就算失业也不算什么啦。
-What does that matter? Before the teahouse closes down, if you hurry to get along with the local old women, find a girl from a rich family to marry, get in bed with her, have some children, then it won’t matter even if you lose your job.

李肇维：
学姐你说什么啊。。。。。。
-What are you saying…

谢霁云：
你们这些小鬼，什么事都别想瞒过我。
-Don’t think that you brats can fool me with anything.

先辈在我鼻子扭了一把。
她似乎洒过香水，飘过来的味道跟房东不同。
-Senpai gives my nose a pinch.
-She seems to be wearing perfume, and the smell that drifts over is different from that of the landlady.

谢霁云：
打从你们兄弟上工后，这一带的婆婆妈妈可高兴得很。
-Since you two brothers started working, the old women in this area became very happy.

谢霁云：
基隆这里好久没有年轻帅气又有为的男孩子出现了，加上你还是在日本读过书的学生，这身价可就更不同。
-Keelung hasn’t had handsome and promising young men appear for a long time, on top of that you have studied in Japan, so your value is even better.

李肇维：
那只是街坊邻居大家爱说笑而已啦。
-That’s just the neighbours joking around.

谢霁云：
特别是你，肇维，你的身价比弟弟更好。
-Especially you, Zhao Wei, you are more valuable than your younger brother.

谢霁云：
毕竟跟整天在外面结交不知来头的朋友的浪子相比，苦干实干的老实汉子还是比较可靠嘛。
-Compared with that loafer who makes friends with people of dubious backgrounds all day, an honest hard-working man is more reliable.

李肇维：
我只是不得不这么做。学姐你也知道，我这种没毕业的学生，根本挣不了几个钱。现在光是房租，就够我头痛了。
-I can’t live any other way. You’re also aware that I never graduated so I can’t earn more than a small wage. Right now everything I earn is spent on rent, which is enough to give me a headache.

谢霁云：
那么，要不要给学姐包养一下？
-In that case, would you like me to take care of you for a while?

李肇维：
唉？
-Eh?

谢霁云：
保证你们兄弟俩，从此以后都不需要担心房租喔~~
-I guarantee that from now on you and your brother will never need to worry about rent again~~

李肇维：
不。。。。。。那个。。。。。。我能自己做的话，自己做就好了。
-No… That is… If I am able to do something on my own, then I should do it myself.

谢霁云：
哼，你弟弟说不定会犹豫一下呢。
-Hmph, your little brother might have hesitated for a moment.

李肇维：
他性情还不定嘛。
-That’s because he is uncertain by nature.

谢霁云：
无趣的男人。
-You’re such an uninteresting man.

李肇维：
我确实不懂笑话要怎么说。
-I honestly don’t know how to tell a joke.

谢霁云：
唉。。。。。。不闹你了。
-Eh… I won’t tease you anymore.

李肇维：
原来学姐到刚才为止都是在闹我吗？
-So you were teasing me from the start?

谢霁云：
就是因为你钝成这样，才会让人忍不住想多说几句吧。。。。。。
-It’s because you’re dim-witted like this, so people can’t resist saying a few extra lines…

谢霁云：
记住了，这是学姐善意的提醒。从今以后，日语最好别说，不，是绝对别用。
-This is my kind reminder, remember it. From today onwards, it is best not to speak Japanese, no, absolutely do not use Japanese.

李肇维：
为什么？
-Why?

谢霁云：
虽然台湾在日本长期的统治下，说日语已经变得没有什么。
-Taiwan was under Japanese rule for a long time and speaking Japanese became commonplace.

谢霁云：
但是你想想，如果你是统治者，你会喜欢自己低下的人，成天说着“敌人”的语言吗？
-But you should consider that, if you were a ruler, would you like the people under you speaking all day in the language of the “enemy”?

李肇维：
学姐说的太夸张了啦，敌人什么的，我们只不过是寻常老百姓啊。
-You’re exaggerating. There’s no enemy. We’re just ordinary civilians.

谢霁云：
所以才更糟。
-That’s why it’s even worse.

谢霁云：
就像当初日本人来的时候一样，当时的“寻常老百姓”们，也被狠狠地“教育”过“不准说汉语”。
-It’s like when the Japanese first arrived, the “ordinary civilians” at that time were brutally “educated” that they were “not allowed to use Chinese”.

谢霁云：
所以将来还想过日子，就得记住，别惹统治者生气。
-So if you still want to live, you must remember, never provoke the anger of the rulers.

谢霁云：
第一步就是装上这条新尾巴，全力摇尾乞怜，告诉对方“我没有判意”。
-The first step is to put on this new tail, wag it as hard as you can to beg, and tell them “I have no intention to discriminate”.

学姐有意无意地指着挂满街上的三色旗。
-Ji Yun carelessly points at the three-coloured flags that fill the street.

李肇维：
学姐你说的太扯了啦，黄伯他们都说，国民政府是自己人，自己人管自己人，哪需要担心这种小事情？
-What you are saying is too amusing. Uncle Huang and the others say that the National Government are our own people, that it will be our own people ruling our own people, so why should we be worried about this kind of thing?

谢霁云：
我并不讨厌你的积极思考，但就因为是小事情，才会更致命。
-I don’t hate your optimism, but this is all the more serious because it is a small matter.

学姐凑近我的脸。
我几乎可以闻到她的呼吸。
-Ji Yun brought her face close to mine.
-I could almost smell her breath.

谢霁云：
日本也好，国府也好，两边都不能算是自己人。
-It doesn’t matter whether it is the Japanese or the National Government, neither side can be considered as our own people.

李肇维：
学姐妳说什么？
-What are you saying?

谢霁云：
我说——这可是秘密喔——我希望有一天，是由我们台湾人，来管台湾人。
-I’m saying – and keep this a secret – I hope that one day, Taiwanese will be governed by Taiwanese.

谢霁云：
在那天来临前，别说日语，好好摇着尾巴活下去吧，学弟。
-Until that day arrives, don’t speak Japanese, just wag your tail and stay alive.

学姐帅气地挥手离去，我立刻追上。
-Ji Yun coolly waved and turned to go, so I immediately chased after her.

李肇维：
学姐等一下！妳该不会说，要由台湾出生的人来管台湾人吧？
-Wait! Are you saying that people born in Taiwan should rule Taiwanese?

谢霁云：
嗯？是不是台湾人，可以只用“出生在那里”这么单纯的问题来决定吗？学弟
-Hm? Can you only use such a simple question as “where are you born” to decide whether you are Taiwanese or not?

谢霁云：
这里头应该还有很多很多，决定我们到底是“那里人”的东西吧？
-Your head should have a lot of ideas about how to decide whether we are “people of that country”, shouldn’t it?

李肇维：
学姐。。。。。。！
-Ji Yun…!

谢霁云：
这个问题的答案，就等你下回帮学姐分解，我还有事，先走一步。
-I’ll wait until we meet again for you to help me resolve the answer to this question. I have business to attend to, so I’ll take my leave.

学姐踏着轻快的脚步离去。
-Ji Yun walks away with quick steps.

李肇维：
我还是不懂妳在说些什么啊。。。。。。
-I still don’t understand what you were saying…

不靠出生地决定，还能靠什么东西决定？
不就因为我们出生在台湾，所以是台湾人吗？
-If the place of birth is not used, what else can be used to decide?
-Isn’t it because we are born in Taiwan, that’s why we are Taiwanese?

中国人、日本人，也是因为他们出生在那个地方，所以才叫做那里人啊。
-Chinese and Japanese are called Chinese and Japanese because of where they are born.

可是听学姐的意思，生在台湾的，其实不算是台湾人？
怎么可能？
-But according to Ji Yun, someone born in Taiwan is actually not Taiwanese?
-How could that be?

不懂，真的搞不懂。
-I don’t understand, I really don’t understand.

李肇维：
不过比起那些我不懂的事情。。。。。。
-But compared to the things I don’t know…

街上这些旗子做的还真的克难兼有趣。
-The flags on the street looked difficult and interesting to make.

旗面到处都是缝补的痕迹，红色与白色的部分，还是直接改自日本的红白太阳旗。
-The face of each flag was covered with sewn on patterns, and the red and white parts were directly taken from the Japanese red and white sun flag.

战争时，大家过的都苦，克勤克俭也要做出这些旗帜迎接国民政府军，对方看了不知会不会高兴？
-During the war, everyone went through hardship, yet flags were diligently made to welcome the National Government soldiers. Would the soldiers be happy after seeing the flags?

会不会感受到，我们彼此都是“自己人”？
-Would they feel that they and we are “our own people”?

#Part 2
？？？
刚才那个女人是谁——
-Who was that woman just now -

李肇维：
哇！
-Wah!

冰冷的语气贯穿我的颈椎。
-An ice-cold voice sends a chill down my spine.

我急忙回过头，站在身后的不是别人，正是临港茶坊的现任当家，茶坊的老老板的独生女——张晓瑜小姐。
-I look behind me in a panic. The one standing behind me is not a stranger. It’s the current manager of Lingang Teahouse, the only child and daughter of the old manager of the teahouse – Miss Zhang Xiao Yu.

虽然平常做生意的时候，她总是笑容可掬态度和善又诚恳。
-When she is normally managing the business, she always has a friendly smile and a kind and sincere personality.

但是只要街坊的婆婆妈妈们缠着我问东问西，特别是提亲娶妻的话题时，她就会摆出这张皮笑肉不笑的恐怖鬼脸。
-But if the old women of the neighbourhood pester me with questions, especially questions about getting married, then a scary superficial smile will appear on her face.

有时候只是路过的妇人找我问路，她也会变出那种表情。
-Sometimes it’s just a passing woman asking me for directions, and her expression turns into that smile.

不过最可怕的还是，在其他人都被吓跑之后，我得独自面对这张脸。
-But the scariest part is that, after everyone else has run away in fright, I have to face her smile alone.

李肇维：
代。。。。。。代理老板？
-A… Acting manager?

张晓瑜：
不要叫我代理老板——
-Don’t call me acting manager -

李肇维：
那。。。。。。我该怎么叫才好？
-Then… What should I call you?

张晓瑜：
像小时候一样，叫我名字就好——
-Call me by my name, like when we were young -

李肇维：
张晓瑜小姐，早。
-Good morning, Miss Zhang Xiao Yu.

张晓瑜：
张跟小姐都是多余的，肇维——
-Miss and Zhang are not necessary, Zhao Wei -

张晓瑜：
刚才那个女人是谁——
-Who was that woman just now -

她朝我逼近了一步。
-She takes a step towards me.

李肇维：
那是我学校的先辈（SENBAI），汉语称学姐。
-That was my senpai from school. A senpai is called an upperclassman in Chinese.

张晓瑜：
真的只是学姐——
-Is she really just your upperclassman -

李肇维：
就只是学姐。
-She is just my upperclassman.

张晓瑜：
你们之间如果有什么的话——绝对不可以瞒着我——喔——
-If there is anything going on between the two of you – you absolutely can’t hide it from me -

李肇维：
那。。。。。。那个。。。。。。对了！学姐她是想来买茶叶，可是茶坊却没开门，才会跟我聊了一下的。
-That… That’s… Right! She came to buy tea leaves, but the teahouse was closed, so she talked to me for a while instead.

张晓瑜：
真——的——？
-Real-ly -?

李肇维：
真的啦，晓瑜妳要相信我嘛。
-Yes, really. Xiao Yu, you must believe me.

张晓瑜：
。。。。。。
-…

张晓瑜：
好，相信你。
-OK, I believe you.

好快！
女孩子长大后，变脸都可以变这么快的吗。
-That was fast!
-When girls grow up, their expression can change so fast.

张晓瑜：
肇维你今天怎么会来？不是上周就讲今天休假了吗？
-Zhao Wei, why are you here today? Didn’t I tell you last week that today would be a holiday?

李肇维：
。。。。。。因为我忘记今天休假了。
-… Because I forgot today is a holiday.

张晓瑜：
咦？不会吧？你忘记了？你忘记我说过的话了？
-Eh? Is that so? You forgot? You forgot something I told you?

李肇维：
那个。。。。。。不好意思，真的就是忘了。
-That’s… I’m sorry, I really forgot.

张晓瑜：
。。。。。。就这个原因？
-… That’s the reason?

李肇维：
就这个原因。
-That’s the reason.

张晓瑜：
你这个笨蛋。。。。。。怎么可以忘记我说过什么呢。。。。。。
-You idiot… How could you forget something I told you…

张晓瑜：
算了。肇维我们走。
-Never mind. Zhao Wei, let’s go.

李肇维：
走。。。。。。走去那里啊走？
-Go… Where are we going?

张晓瑜：
去看迎接光复的队伍啊！
-To watch the crowd that is going to welcome the reclaiming!

李肇维：
不要吧，我不喜欢凑热闹。妳也不适合凑热闹啊。
-Let’s not, I don’t like joining bustling crowds. You’re also not suited to joining bustling crowds.

张晓瑜：
我今天就是要拉你一起凑热闹！就当作为了我这么做！
-Today I’m going to drag you off to join a bustling crowd together! We’re going like it’s for me!

李肇维：
我记得妳以前不是这么硬来的啊。
-I remember that you weren’t so assertive in the past.

张晓瑜：
要怪就怪你自己笨到把人家说过的话忘记了。
-If you want to blame anyone, blame yourself for being stupid enough to forget things people have told you.

晓瑜勾着我，硬是穿过重重人潮。
-Xiao Yu locks her arm in mine and forces our way through the crowd of people.
